# Acquiring Collateral

## Valid Collateral

Sai accepts:

- USDC from any EVM-chain
- stNIBI (Nibiru staking token)

## Getting Started

### Option 1: From a Centralized Exchange (CEX)

1. Purchase ETH, USDC, or NIBI on your preferred exchange
2. Transfer to a self-custodied wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Keplr)
3. Bridge to Nibiru using [Stargate](https://stargate.finance/) or [Hyperlane](https://nexus.hyperlane.xyz/)

### Option 2: Bridging Assets

- **Stargate** (Powered by LayerZero)
- **Hyperlane** (Nexus Bridge)

## Gas Fees

Transactions require NIBI for gas (**WNIBI**: 0x0CaCF669f8446BeCA826913a3c6B96aCD4b02a97).

> Soon: Sai will offer a gasless experience where you won't need gas to sign or run transactions.
