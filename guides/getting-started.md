# Getting started

## Connect Wallet

* **Supported Wallets**: [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/), [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/), [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/) and others.
* **Network Setup**: Ensure your wallet is configured for [Nibiru](https://nibiru.fi/docs/wallets/).
* **Balances**: Ensure you have the correct tokens to use as collateral and gas. Valid collateral will be announced soon.

If you need help connecting or bridging assets, see [Nibiru's bridging guide](https://nibiru.fi/docs/use/bridge.html).

## Choosing a Market

You can trade on various markets (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD, etc.).

1. Open the sai.fun DApp and go to **Trade**.
2. Select your **Market** from the dropdown (e.g., _BTC-PERP_).
3. Check the displayed **Oracle Price** to see the current quote.

## Understanding Collateral & Leverage

* **Collateral** is the margin (in tokens) you deposit to open a leveraged position.
* **Leverage** multiplies your position size relative to your collateral.
* Higher leverage boosts potential profits **and** risks (liquidation becomes more likely).
