# Intro to Sai

Welcome to **Sai.fun**—a perpetual futures trading platform built on Nibiru. With Sai, you can open leveraged positions (long or short) with low fees and low impact trades, set limit orders, stop-losses and take-profits, or earn yield in a fully onchain trading experience.

### Why Sai?

* **Oracle settlement:** Simple and easy price behavior so there's no internal surprises. We rely on a combination of [Nibiru's Oracle](https://nibiru.fi/docs/ecosystem/oracle/), which aggregates prices from leading exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX through Nibiru's decentralized validator network, and custom feeds for certain markets.
* **Leverage**: Amplify your exposure with up to 150x leverage (exact max set by each market and pairs).
* **Simple On-Chain Experience**: Manage everything in one intuitive UI, leveraging one click trading, automated order triggering etc.
* **Custom Orders**: Market, limit, stop, and advanced triggers for Take Profits and Stop Losses.
