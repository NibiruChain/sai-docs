### 5. Services; The Interface; Blockchain Fees.

We provide software that allows users to connect their digital asset wallet to our Website or Interface. As a result, the connection with your wallet relies on third-party services.

YOU AGREE TO ASSUME ALL RISK RELATED TO ANY BUGS, ERRORS, VULNERABILITIES, OR EXPLOITS THAT MAY EXIST IN THE SERVICES AND ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW), WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OR INTERACTION WITH THE WEBSITE, INTERFACE, OR SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SAI WAIVES ALL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES RELATED TO THE SERVICES.

To use the Services, you will have to create an account (a “SAI Account”) via the Website or Interface. You agree that you will not disclose your SAI Account access credentials, including any usernames and passwords associated with your SAI Account, to anyone or otherwise provide anyone else with access to your SAI Account credentials. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your SAI Account, or are otherwise referable to your SAI Account credentials, whether or not you know about such activities.

Once you create your SAI Account, you will be permitted to connect your digital asset wallet via the supported blockchain networks.

You acknowledge and understand that, in certain circumstances, such as if you lose or are otherwise unable to access your login credentials associated with your SAI Account, you may be unable to access the Website, the Interface, or the Services, and to engage in any of the features allowed by those platforms.

&#x20;

Your full use and enjoyment of the Website, the Interface, or the Services may require you to pay transactional fees, or other types of fees, both to SAI and possibly as may be required by the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger service or that are used to encourage intended use among the underlying blockchain’s participants (“Blockchain Fees”). While certain fees may be set and levied by SAI, including for transactions and activities such as opening and closing a position, or a funding rate associated with a transaction, certain Blockchain Fees are not levied directly by SAI, but rather are determined by your use of the Services and the rules placed by corresponding blockchain communities at large. You acknowledge that SAI has no control over Blockchain Fees, (including without limitation their applicability, payment, amounts, transmission, intended operation, and effectiveness) whether related to your use of the Services or otherwise, and agree that in no event will SAI be responsible to you or any other party for the payment, repayment, refund, disbursement, indemnity, or for any other aspect of your use or transmission of Blockchain Fees. For further information regarding blockchain technology, digital assets, and the associated risks, _see_ the Section below entitled **Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims**.

### 6. Monitoring & Enforcement; Termination

We have the right to:

·       Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Website, the Interface, or the Services.

·       Terminate, prevent, or suspend your access to all or part of the Website, the Interface, or the Services for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of these Terms of Use.

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Website, the Interface, or the Services. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS SAI AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY SAI/ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

However, we cannot review interactions or activities before they are executed through the Interface, and, given the nature of blockchain and functionalities like those offered via the Services, cannot ensure prompt removal or rectification of objectionable interactions or activities after they have been executed. Accordingly, the User agrees that we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, transactions, blockchain operations, or content provided by any User or third party, including any that may cause a malfunction or inaccuracy on the Website or among the Services. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for any other party’s performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this Section, nor for any harms or damages created by others’ interactions with any blockchain underlying the Services or reliance on the information or content presented on the Website.

### 7. Changes to the Terms of Use

We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in the Section below entitled Governing Law & Jurisdiction will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice before the date the change is posted on the Website or the Interface.

The User’s continued use of the Website, the Interface, or the Services following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that the User accepts and agrees to the changes. **The User is expected to check this page each time it accesses this Website, the Interface, or the Services so it is aware of any changes, as they are binding on the User**.

### 8. Accessing the Website or the Interface & User Security.

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Website or the Interface, and any other Services or material we provide on the Website or the Interface, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website, the Interface, the public blockchains underlying the Services, or any of the Services are unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of or all of the Website or the Interface to Users.

The User is responsible for both:

●       Making all arrangements necessary for the User to have access to the Website, the Interface, and the Services.

●       Ensuring that all persons who access the Website, the Interface, or the Services through the User’s internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

To access certain Services or some of the resources offered on the Website or the Interface, the User may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. Other Services or resources offered on the Website or Interface may require the User to utilize certain Web3 capabilities, such a digital asset wallet capable of interacting with the User’s web browser or relevant blockchain nodes (“Web3 Utilities”). It is a condition of the User’s use of the Website, the Interface, and the Services that the User only operate such Web3 Utilities with a private key(s) that the User created or has the direct, explicit permission of the party who created the relevant private key(s). The User agrees that all information it provides to interact with the Website, Interface, Services, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Website (such as registration information) is correct, current, and complete, and is governed by our Privacy Policy. The User consents to all actions we take with respect to the User’s information as is consistent with our Privacy Policy.

If the User utilizes a Web3 Utility that relies on a separate username, password, private key, or any other piece of information as part of its security procedures, the User must treat such information as confidential, and the User must not disclose that information to any other person or entity. The User also acknowledges that any identity linked to its Web3 Utility is personal to the User and agrees not to provide any other person with access to such identity. The User also agrees to ensure that it will lock or otherwise prevent its Web3 Utility from unauthorized use on the Website, the Interface, or the Services at the end of each session. The User should use particular caution when accessing the Website, the Interface, or the Services from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record the User’s username, password, private key, or other personal information. For further information regarding Magic Keys, Safe Words, and Wallet security, _see_ the Section below entitled Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.

We have the right to disable the User’s access, including those associated with a Web3 Utility (such as that represented by a public address), to the Website, the Interface, or the Services, or to block any IP address from accessing the Website, the Interface, or the Services at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, the User or that identity has violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

●       Use any illustrations, photographs, video or audio sequences, or any graphics separately from the accompanying text.

●       Delete or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices from copies of materials from the Website or the Interface.

If the User wishes to make any use of material on the Website or the Interface other than that set out in this Section, it should address its request to: sai { at } nibiru.org.

If the User prints, copies, modifies, downloads, or otherwise uses or provides any other person with access to any part of the Website or the Interface in breach of these Terms of Use, the User’s right to access the Website and the Interface will stop immediately and the User must, at our option, return or destroy any copies of the materials the User has made. No right, title, or interest in or to the Website, the Interface, or any content on either is transferred to the User, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by SAI.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Use, the User may freely use any open-sourced materials up to the limits provided, but in accordance with any requirements placed, by those materials’ or properties’ applicable licenses.

Any use of the Website not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.

### 10. Trademarks

The SAI name and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of SAI or its affiliates or licensors. You must not use such marks without the prior written permission of SAI; provided, however, User is hereby granted a limited, revocable, non-transferable permission and license to use the term “SAI” and any related names (excluding the SAI name), logos (excluding the Company logo), product and service names, designs, and slogans in any way that they desire so long as such usage is not done in a way that: (1) is deceitful, fraudulent, or manipulative; (2) implies any relationship between User and SAI beyond that reasonably typical of the administrator of a website and its users; or (3) to cause confusion in any way to gain digital assets of, or personal information about, another party other than that intended by the Services, the Wallet, the Interface or any related or interacting functionality (for example, you may not use the foregoing marks to execute phishing attacks, spearphishing attacks, social engineering, or in any way that may cause a party to transmit digital assets to an unintended recipient or to reveal private information, like a private key or password). All other names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans on the Website and the Interface are the trademarks of their respective owners, if applicable.

## 6.     Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.

Blockchains, digital assets, the Wallet, Smart Accounts, Dapps, Web3 Utilities, and their related technologies and functionalities are still emerging innovations that carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with blockchains requires high degrees of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. digital assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including without limitation use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies, such as blockchains like those underlying the Wallet, is variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with any blockchain may be publicly visible and readable in human form.

By accessing and using the Website, the Interface, or the Services, the User acknowledges the foregoing, and agrees and represents that it understands such and other risks involved with blockchains, the Wallet, and related technologies (including without limitation any specific technical language used in this Agreement). The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is informed of all foreseeable risks, and the possibility of unforeseeable risks, associated with blockchains, digital assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, the Interface, the Wallet, and the Services. The User further acknowledges, and assumes all risk related to the possibility, that any information presented via the Website, Interface, or Services may be inaccurate, possibly due to another party’s malicious activities and possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment. The User agrees that we are not responsible for any of these or related risks, do not own or control any blockchain and cannot guarantee the safe or accurate functioning of the Services, and shall not be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Website or the Services. Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Website and interacting with the Services, whether mentioned in this Section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Website and the Interface, and the User’s interaction with the Services.

If the User is a California resident, the User expressly and explicitly waives the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which states: “\[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

## 7.     No Professional Advice.

All information or content provided or displayed by the Website (including without limitation, on the Interface) is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice (including, without limitation, tax, legal, or financial advice). The User should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information or content displayed or provided on the Website, on the Interface, or through the Services. The User should seek independent professional advice from an individual licensed and qualified in the area appropriate for such before the User makes any financial, legal, or other decisions where such is considered prudent. The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permissible by law, it has not relied on SAI, the content on the Website, the Interface, or the Services for any professional advice related to its financial or legal behaviors.

Additionally, it is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the Website, the Interface, the Wallet and/or the Services, and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.

## 8.     No Fiduciary Duties.

These Terms of Use, and the provision of the Website, the Interface, and the Services, are not intended to create any fiduciary duties between us and the User or any third party. To the fullest extent permissible by law, the User agrees that neither the User’s use of the Website or the Interface, or of the Services causes us or any User to owe fiduciary duties or liabilities to the User or any third party. Further, the User acknowledges and agrees to the fullest extent such duties or liabilities are afforded by law or by equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated, and that we and any other User shall be held completely harmless in relation thereof. The User further agrees that the only duties and obligations that we or any User owes the User, and the only rights the User has related to this Agreement or the User’s use of the Website, the Interface, or the Services, are those set out expressly in this Agreement or that cannot be waived by law.

## 9.     No Insurance.

Your digital asset wallet and digital asset balances contained therein are not checking or savings accounts, and we do not provide any kind of insurance to you against any type of loss, including (without limitation) losses due to decrease in value of assets, assets lost due to a cybersecurity failure, or from your or other individuals’ errors or malfeasance. In most jurisdictions digital assets are not legal tender, and most digital assets are not backed by any government. Your digital asset balances are not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) protections.&#x20;

We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and the User acknowledges and agrees that we do not and will not accept any responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from the User’s use of them. If the User decides to access any of the third-party websites linked to the Website, the User does so entirely at its own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.

## 11.  Indemnification. <a href="#bookmark-id.19c6y18" id="bookmark-id.19c6y18"></a>

## 12.  Governing Law & Jurisdiction. <a href="#bookmark-id.28h4qwu" id="bookmark-id.28h4qwu"></a>

All matters relating to the Website, the Interface, the Services, and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of Panama without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of Panama or any other jurisdiction).

## 13.  Arbitration; Class Arbitration Waiver. <a href="#heading-h.1mrcu09" id="heading-h.1mrcu09"></a>

In the event of a dispute between you, the User, and SAI (each a “Party” and _collectively_, the “Parties”) related to these Terms of Use or the breach thereof, the Parties shall participate in at least one (1) live or teleconferenced (_i.e._, using Zoom or a similar videoconferencing software that allows the Parties to communicate in real time) mediation session with the International Center for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”) neutral. The Parties agree to participate in mediation in good faith and the Parties agree to share equally in the cost of such mediation.

Should the Dispute not be settled within seven (7) days following the live mediation session, either Party may then commence a binding arbitration administered in Panama, or if the ICDR is unable to administer the arbitration in Panama, then the nearest jurisdiction where it can do so. A single arbitrator shall preside, and proceedings shall be conducted remotely to the maximum extent possible. Each Party shall pay its own expenses in such arbitration, including its attorneys’ fees, subject to reapportionment by the arbitrator in a final award. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in such proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled. Any interim or provisional relief that would be available from a court of law shall be available in accordance with the rules of Panama, however, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Parties from obtaining preliminary injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction located in Panama or another mutually acceptable jurisdiction if necessary to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any arbitration. The final arbitration award may be confirmed in a court located in the Panama and the Parties agree to waive any claim of improper venue or _forum non conveniens_. Except as may be required by law, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. The Parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that these Terms of Use do not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. In the event the prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of the arbitration agreement will remain in force.

## 14.  Limitation on Time to File Claims. <a href="#bookmark-id.2lwamvv" id="bookmark-id.2lwamvv"></a>

## 15.  Waiver & Severability. <a href="#bookmark-id.3l18frh" id="bookmark-id.3l18frh"></a>

No waiver by SAI of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of SAI to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
